Find the students with the highest grade in each class for all classes.
The program should return a JSON array with each JSON object in the array containing 
the following fields:
First,Last,Year,Class,Grade.
Nothing else should be returned and written to the file by the program.
If multiple students had the same highest grade, then return any one of them.
